        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p> My name is Anointing Iyawe. I am a student of Durham college,
                and this is my second degree, I graduated with a diploma in mechanical engennering.
                It is not easy being an international student, but the change of environment
                is nice, and the experience has been a rollercoaster.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>I want to make new friends and settle in the environment, but undersrtanding
                the culture and the environment comes first. I met people who have made my stay great,
                and they have been very welcoming. I don't want to name names, but adjusting feels so easy. 
        </p>

        <strong>Some of my Interests are:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li> It is always nice to explore and visit new environments</li>

             and it is more fun than I thought.</li>

           </ul>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>

        <p>I have so many hobbies, and I don't like limiting myself because the is a lot to explore.
            It is fun when you don't put limits on the things that might seem fun. I have always been open-minded, 
            and it makes it easy for me to learn.

        <strong>Passions</strong>

        I have Passions for art work, and it tends to put me in deep thoughts trying to imagine what
        was going through the mind of the artist when he/she created the work of art. I also like natural sceneries 
        because it speaks to me. Being in nature can be inspiring, and peaceful.
